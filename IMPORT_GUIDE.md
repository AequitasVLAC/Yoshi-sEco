## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Import Fails
- **Issue:** "Invalid import string"
- **Solution:** Make sure you copied the **entire** string (it's very long!)
- **Alternative:** Use the JSON file method instead

### Commands Don't Work
- **Issue:** Command not responding
- **Check:**
  1. Command is **Enabled** in Commands tab
  2. Streamer.bot is **connected to Twitch**
  3. You have the required currency/tokens
  4. Loyalty system is **enabled**

### Code Won't Compile
- **Issue:** Compilation error
- **Solution:** The code is pre-tested and should compile. If it doesn't:
  1. Check Streamer.bot version (needs v0.2.0+)
  2. Try re-importing the file
  3. Check Streamer.bot logs for specific errors

### Duels Never Resolve
- **Issue:** Duel accepted but never resolves
- **Check:**
  1. Timed Action for "Duel Resolver" exists
  2. Timer is **Enabled** (checkbox)
  3. Interval is set to **60 seconds**
  4. **Repeat** is enabled

### Variables Not Persisting
- **Issue:** Tokens/stats reset on Streamer.bot restart
- **Solution:** All variables use `persisted: true` by default. Check:
  1. Streamer.bot has write permissions to its data folder
  2. No errors in Streamer.bot logs
  3. Variables appear in Settings → Variables

## 📊 Economy Balance Guide

### Fund Monitoring
Check funds regularly with `!econfunds`:

### When to Adjust

**If eggs inflate too fast:**
- Reduce passive income rates
- Increase token costs

**If games played too often:**
- Increase command cooldowns
- Adjust game rewards

**If funds grow too large:**
