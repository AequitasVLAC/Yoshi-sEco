### Yoshi's Island Eggonomy

Yoshi's Island has a unique economy system—better dubbed 'eggonomy'—where the entire cycle revolves around the creation, management, and effective use of eggs within the ecosystem. Below, I've consolidated the key components and mechanisms behind this whimsical yet intriguing system.

#### 1. The Egg Generation Cycle
Yoshis generate eggs not just as projectiles but as functional assets:
- **Input Sources**: Consuming fruit or enemies.
- **Specifications**: Different colors of eggs possess special effects (e.g., yellow makes coins, red gives health).

#### 2. The Exchange Economy
Eggs have varied uses that form an exchange scheme:
- **Combat Currency**: Yoshi pays for level progression.
- **Health and Lives Trade**: Special eggs restore stamina or extra attempts.

#### 3. Environmental Interaction
Yoshi's eggs interact with environment puzzles and secret areas, adding layers to the 'eggonomic' design:
   - Unlock pathways.
   - Activate hidden areas.
